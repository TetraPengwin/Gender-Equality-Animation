# Gender-Equality-Animation

This was for a work placement program where we had to bring up a problem and propose how to fix it

I would not suggest looking at the code unless you want to lose braincells rapidly, but if that's something you actually _want_ to do i'm not going to stop you

If your actually crazy enough to optimize this I will gladly accept your sacrifice and merge your PR (assuming I remember this exists by the time you submit a PR)
